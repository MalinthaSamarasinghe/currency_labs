### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/currency_converter_app.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```dart
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Set Up API Key
- Register on the public API platform ðŸ‘‰ [ExchangeRatesAPI](https://exchangeratesapi.io/)
- Note the free-tier limitations and available endpoints.
- Add your API key in the following file:
```dart
// File: lib/utils/api_endpoints.dart
static const apiKEY = 'your_api_key_here';
```

### 4. Firebase Configuration:
- Create a Firebase project in your account.
- Add both Android and iOS apps to the Firebase project.
- Download the google-services.json file for Android and GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS.
- Place these files in the appropriate directories as per Firebase setup instructions.

### 5. Testing API Endpoints:
- Use Postman to check and validate endpoints, parameters, and responses before integrating them into the app.

### 6. Run the App
```dart
flutter run
```

## Architecture
- The app is built using Clean Architecture with a focus on scalability and separation of concerns.
- State Management: Used the <a href="https://bloclibrary.dev/#/"><img src="https://tinyurl.com/bloc-library" alt="Bloc Library"></a> library to manage state effectively and ensure a reactive UI.
- Folder Structure:
```bash

## Best Coding Practices
- Directories and files should be named in `snake_case`.
```
dir_one
â””â”€â”€ my_folder
    â”œâ”€â”€ example.dart
    â””â”€â”€ custom_class.dart
```

- All private variables and private methods should not start with underscores
```dart
// Do
bool isLoading = true;
void myFunction() {}

// Do not
bool _isLoading = true;
void _myFunction() {}
```

- Constants, variables, parameters, and named parameters should be named in `lowerCamelCase`
- Classes, types, extension names, and enums should be typed in `UpperCamelCase`
- Proper and **meaningful** naming practices should be followed
